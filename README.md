# ANS Cybernetics
 
A responsive, consumer-facing POS system built around a cyberpunk-themed aesthetic, enabling users to shop for cybernetic enhancements in various categories. 

Users may browse from a selection of product categories. Upon clicking on any of the "View Product" buttons, a quick view window appears allowing users to choose from a dropdown menu of options and add the item to their cart.

Users may then view their cart and order summary, and choose to checkout
via either the cash or card options. Once the purchase is complete, users
receive a receipt.
